### Draft 1.1: Internship Program Proposal

#### Introduction

**Background:**
The Maldives civil service sector is a vital component of the country's governance and public service delivery. Ensuring a skilled and efficient workforce is crucial for the effective functioning of this sector. One approach to achieve this is through the introduction of structured internship programs that can provide practical work experience to young individuals while supporting the civil service in managing its workload.

**Purpose:**
This paper aims to propose an internship program within the civil service framework. The program seeks to create opportunities for school leavers and graduates at various educational levels to gain valuable work experience, receive fair compensation, and contribute to the public service.

#### Current Framework

**Existing Laws and Regulations:**
The Maldives Civil Service Regulation and the Employment Act outline the standards and procedures for employment, including training and development. However, there is no explicit mention of structured internship programs for school leavers within these regulations.

**Gaps and Opportunities:**
The lack of a formal internship framework presents an opportunity to introduce a program that aligns with the national pay standards and best practices from other countries, such as the UK. This program can fill the gaps by offering structured training and development pathways for young individuals.

#### Proposed Internship Program

**Program Structure:**
The proposed internship program will cater to individuals with varying educational backgrounds:
- **Basic Literacy and Grade 5 Completers**: Internships focusing on basic administrative tasks and skill-building activities.
- **Grades 8, 9, and 10 Completers**: Internships involving moderate administrative responsibilities, data entry tasks, and project assistance.
- **A-Level Completers**: Advanced administrative roles, project management tasks, and specialized assignments relevant to their field of study.

**Compensation:**
Interns will receive a fair allowance or salary that complies with the national pay standards. This compensation will ensure that interns are fairly rewarded for their contributions and can support themselves during the internship period.

**Supervision and Support:**
Each intern will be assigned a supervisor who will provide guidance and support throughout the internship. Regular check-ins and feedback sessions will ensure that interns are on track and developing the necessary skills.

**Inclusivity Across Education Levels:**
The program will be inclusive, allowing individuals from various educational backgrounds to participate. This approach ensures that the civil service can tap into a diverse talent pool and provide equal opportunities for all.

#### Benefits

**For Interns:**
- Gain practical work experience and develop essential skills.
- Receive fair compensation, which can support their educational and personal needs.
- Enhance their employability and career prospects within the civil service or other sectors.

**For Civil Service:**
- Manage workload more efficiently by assigning smaller tasks to interns.
- Bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas into the public service.
- Develop a pipeline of skilled workers who can transition into permanent roles.

#### Implementation Plan

**Phases:**
1. **Pilot Phase**: Implement the internship program in a few selected departments to test its feasibility and effectiveness.
2. **Full Rollout**: Expand the program across all relevant departments based on the feedback and success of the pilot phase.

**Evaluation:**
Regular monitoring and evaluation will be conducted to assess the program's impact and identify areas for improvement. Feedback from interns and supervisors will be collected to ensure continuous enhancement of the program.

#### Conclusion

**Summary:**
The proposed internship program offers a structured and inclusive approach to developing a skilled workforce within the Maldives civil service. By providing practical work experience, fair compensation, and comprehensive support, the program can significantly benefit both the interns and the civil service sector.

**Call to Action:**
The Civil Service Commission is encouraged to consider this proposal and take the necessary steps to implement the internship program, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.
