### Final Email to Local Government Authority (LGA)

**Subject:** Urgent: Issues Concerning Council President and Request for Intervention

**To:** Dr. Mariyam Zulfa, CEO, Local Government Authority (LGA)  
**CC:** Government President of the Maldives, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government and Cities, Anti-Corruption Commission, Atoll Council Secretary General

**Dear Dr. Mariyam Zulfa,**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a series of serious issues and incidents within the Hirimaradhoo Council, particularly involving the Council President. These matters have significantly impacted my ability to perform my duties as the Secretary General of Hirimaradhoo Council since my appointment on November 29, 2023, and have created a challenging work environment.

For a detailed account, I have attached a comprehensive document outlining all relevant points and incidents. Below, I provide a brief summary of the key issues:

1. **Legitimate Use and Return of Office Laptop:**
   - I have been using the office laptop as my primary device since early 2024. Due to harassment by the Council President, who repeatedly called me a "laptop thief," I have returned the laptop and requested a proper workstation, but have not received any response.

2. **Improper Cash Management:**
   - Current practices for managing cash funds do not comply with public finance regulations. Cash should be requested from the Ministry of Finance as petty cash, rather than being taken directly from the safe.

3. **Lack of Proper Planning and Interference in Procedures:**
   - Activities are often carried out without adequate planning or financial consideration. The Council President interferes in procurement procedures, canceling bids without following regulations, and influences decisions that should follow established protocols.

4. **Interference in Bidding Procedures:**
   - After my arrival, the Council President canceled three bids and asked me to re-advertise them. Although I attempted to follow the rules and regulations, the bid committee was not constituted according to financial regulations and needs renewal. Additionally, the Council President forced me to advertise bids for constructing a vehicle garage and a storage building for gas, rice, sugar, and flour. Despite my insistence on completing necessary documents before any bid procedure, he pressured me to proceed. The advertisement was made, but due to inadequate documentation and lack of interest, it did not progress further.

5. **Barrier to Correction and Education:**
   - The Council President is not creating an environment conducive to correcting and educating the council and staff about proper procedures.

6. **Personal Attacks, Defamation, and Harassment:**
   - The Council President has made numerous personal and unfounded accusations against me, including calling me a "thief," "sorcerer," "mad person," and alleging that I cannot think properly. He has also accused me of harming public property, lying, doing bad things, and engaging in corrupt activities. Additionally, he has undermined my management skills by labeling me as merely an IT person.

7. **Physical Intimidation (June 23, 2024, 9:00 to 9:28 AM):**
   - On June 23, 2024, the Council President confronted me angrily, hit the office laptop, and physically intimidated me by pushing my forehead forcefully.

8. **Stress and Health Impact:**
   - The ongoing stress from these incidents has led to health issues, requiring psychiatric consultation and medication.

9. **Council Presidentâ€™s Experience:**
   - The Council President has served multiple terms and should be aware of the rules and regulations. If he is aware, his actions are purposeful and with full knowledge; if not, it indicates a significant gap in understanding despite his experience.

These issues require urgent intervention to ensure a fair and functional working environment within the Hirimaradhoo Council. I kindly request your immediate assistance in addressing these concerns.

This email is being CC'd to the President of the Maldives, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Local Government and Cities, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and the Atoll Council Secretary General to ensure all relevant authorities are informed and can assist in resolving these issues.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope for a positive resolution. I am available for further discussion and can provide additional information if needed.
