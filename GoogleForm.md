Sure, I understand. Let's revise the instructions accordingly:

### Setting Up Automatic ID Check on Google Forms with Google Sheets

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Form and Response Sheet
1. **Create a Google Form**:
   - Go to Google Forms and create a new form.
   - Add a question for the ID number (Short Answer).
   - Add any other required questions.

2. **Set Up the Response Sheet**:
   - Click on the "Responses" tab in the Google Form.
   - Click on the green Sheets icon to create a response sheet where all form submissions will be collected.

#### Step 2: Prepare a Sheet with Approved ID Numbers
1. **Create a New Google Sheet**:
   - Open Google Sheets and create a new sheet.
   - Name this sheet "ApprovedIDs".
   - In column A, list all approved ID numbers (one ID per row).

#### Step 3: Write the Script
1. **Open the Script Editor**:
   - Open the Google Sheets response sheet.
   - Click on `Extensions` -> `Apps Script` to open the script editor.

2. **Add the Script**:
   - Delete any code in the script editor and paste the following script:

     ```javascript
     function checkNewResponse(e) {
       // Get the response sheet and the approved ID sheet
       var responseSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Form Responses 1");
       var approvedIDSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("ApprovedIDs");
       
       // Get the last response from the event object
       var lastRow = responseSheet.getLastRow();
       var idNumber = e.values[1]; // Assuming ID number is in the second column
       
       // Get all approved IDs
       var approvedIDs = approvedIDSheet.getRange("A:A").getValues().flat();
       
       // Check if the ID number is approved
       var status = approvedIDs.includes(idNumber) ? "✅" : "❌";
       
       // Update the status in the response sheet
       responseSheet.getRange(lastRow, responseSheet.getLastColumn() + 1).setValue(status);
     }
     ```

   - This script will check if the ID number is in the list of approved IDs and update the status column with a tick mark (✅) if approved, or a cross mark (❌) if not approved.

3. **Save the Script**:
   - Click on the disk icon to save the script. You can name the project "ID Check Script".

#### Step 4: Set Up the Trigger
1. **Open the Triggers Settings**:
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the clock icon (Triggers) in the left sidebar.

2. **Create a New Trigger**:
   - Click on `+ Add Trigger`.
   - Set the function to `checkNewResponse`.
   - Set the event source to `From form`.
   - Set the event type to `On form submit`.
   - Click on `Save`.

#### Final Steps
1. **Authorize the Script**:
   - When you set up the trigger, you may be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the script.

2. **Test the Setup**:
   - Submit a test response through your Google Form using both an approved and a non-approved ID to ensure the script is working as expected.

### File Names Used
- **Google Form Response Sheet**: "Form Responses 1"
- **Approved IDs Sheet**: "ApprovedIDs"

### Notes
- If you choose to change the names of the sheets, you must update the script accordingly:
  - Change `var responseSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Form Responses 1");` to match the new name of your response sheet.
  - Change `var approvedIDSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("ApprovedIDs");` to match the new name of your approved IDs sheet.

By following these steps, every time a new response is submitted, the script will automatically check the ID number against the list of approved IDs and update the response sheet with a tick mark (✅) for approved or a cross mark (❌) for not approved.
