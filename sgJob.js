To Whom It Concern
I understand that Mr Hussain Shareef (National ID A147829) is exploring employment options and has asked me to support his application to this end.   Having worked with Mr Shareef since November 2018 when I started my assignment as Project Director for the New Passenger Terminal Project at MACL, until June 2020, I am very well acquainted with many aspects of his competencies and overall work ethics.

While Mr Shareef’s core skill may be Information Technology, my interactions with him lead me to assess that this is only one aspect of other very strong skills he possesses and which will be of immense use in a project or general management organization. In addition to his primary duties of IT and admin support to the project office as Officer, Administrative, he has often been tasked with provide project management related assistance by the team in the Project Office. I am inclined to make special mention of his strong aptitude for document management and control – especially given how systematic he was in handling this aspect in an office with as large a project document control work load as the MACL Projects Office. He is also equally very competent in handling project logistics and can very ably assist in tracking and administering project finances.

A very committed and dedicated team player, Shareef is very capable of working independently and has the maturity to prioritize tasks in a high demanding organization. I believe Mr Shareef would be an asset to any organization and am pleased to recommend him for a project or general management position.  Please do not hesitate to contact me for any clarification.

Yours sincerely,
