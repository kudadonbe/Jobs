### Summary of Issues and Incidents within the Hirimaradhoo Council

**To Whom It May Concern,**

This document serves to outline the ongoing issues and incidents that have taken place within the Hirimaradhoo Council, particularly involving the Council President. These matters have significantly impacted my ability to perform my duties as the Secretary General of Hirimaradhoo Council since my appointment on November 29, 2023, and have created a challenging work environment.

#### 1. Legitimate Use and Return of Office Laptop
I have been using the office laptop as my primary device since a trip to Malé in early 2024. The Council President has repeatedly called me a "laptop thief," despite this being the only available system for me to work. Due to this harassment, I have returned the laptop and requested a proper workstation, but I have not received a response.

#### 2. Improper Cash Management
Current practices for managing cash funds do not follow proper procedures. According to the Public Finance Regulations, councils must request petty cash from the Ministry of Finance for minor expenditures. Cash should not be taken directly from the safe for transactions. All petty cash transactions must be properly documented and reported to ensure compliance with public finance regulations.

#### 3. Lack of Proper Planning and Interference in Procedures
Activities are often carried out without adequate planning or financial consideration. The Council President gives immediate tasks without assessing available capacity, and resolutions are passed without proper planning.

#### 4. Interference in Bidding Procedures
After my arrival, the Council President canceled three bids and asked me to re-advertise them. Although I attempted to follow the rules and regulations, the bid committee was not constituted according to financial regulations and needs renewal. Additionally, the Council President forced me to advertise bids for constructing a vehicle garage and a storage building for gas, rice, sugar, and flour. Despite my insistence on completing necessary documents before any bid procedure, he pressured me to proceed. The advertisement was made, but due to inadequate documentation and lack of interest, it did not progress further.

#### 5. Barrier to Correction and Education
The Council President is not creating the environment necessary for me to correct and educate the council and staff about proper procedures, making it difficult to implement necessary changes.

#### 6. Personal Attacks, Defamation, and Harassment
The Council President has made personal and unfounded accusations against me, calling me names such as "thief," "sorcerer," "mad person," and alleging that I cannot think properly. He has also accused me of harming public property, making derogatory comments about my mental health, calling me a liar, claiming I do bad things, and accusing me of being a corrupted person. He tells council members that my problem is being an IT person, undermining my management skills despite my extensive past experience in administrative roles.

#### 7. Physical Intimidation (June 23, 2024, 9:00 to 9:28 AM)
On June 23, 2024, between 9:00 to 9:28 AM, the Council President confronted me angrily, accusing me of implying he is corrupt. He hit the office laptop in anger and then physically intimidated me by putting his fingers on my forehead and pushing me back forcefully.

#### 8. Stress and Health Impact
The ongoing stress from these situations has led to health issues, requiring me to consult a psychiatrist and take medication.

#### 9. Council President’s Experience
The Council President has served multiple terms and has significant experience. If he is aware of the rules and regulations, then the actions he is taking are purposeful and with full knowledge. Otherwise, it indicates a lack of awareness despite his experience.

**Summary**
These issues have created a difficult work environment and significantly impeded my ability to perform my duties. I am documenting these incidents to seek resolution and, if necessary, submit this document to the appropriate legal authorities.
